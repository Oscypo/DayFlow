### 🌤️ DayFlow

A simple, elegant daily–planning web app built for learning frontend web development.

Note: This project was created as a learning exercise, and therefore uses localStorage for the login and registration system.
Because of that, authentication is not secure or production-ready.
DayFlow should be treated as a showcase/demo project only.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project uses localStorage for handling:

user registration

user login

task storage

Because localStorage stores data in plain text in the browser, it is not secure and should never be used for real authentication.
DayFlow’s login system exists only for educational purposes — to practice DOM manipulation, state handling, and UI logic.
